###  Module 11: Javascript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

## Overview: 

*Background* 
Dana, a data journalist, has the freedom to write about her hometown in Oregon. She decides her topic will be UFOs and she will use Javascipt to display the data in a cool and interactive dashboard by using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape will be added to increase the interactivity of the dashboard.

*Purpose* 

Making a website more interactive makes it easier for users to engage with the content being presented. In this assignment, the data set is very large so increasing the amount of categories that the users can search within wil make is easier to navigate the data. 

## Results

*How to Perform a Search* 

When a user navigates to the page, they should be able to scroll down and see the raw, unfiltered data in the table on the right. If the user would like to search for UFO sightings based on one of the specific parameters, then they can type in the Date, City, State, Country, or Shape into the Filter Search.
